# DIABETES-PREDICTION-SVM

The project aims to predict diabetes in individuals based on various health indicators. It follows a structured machine learning lifecycle, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, tuning, and evaluation. 

Key highlights include:

Utilization of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel initially.
Model evaluation through accuracy scores, confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.
Optimization of model performance using grid search with cross-validation.
Exploration of alternative SVM kernels (sigmoid and RBF) for comparison.
Mitigation of class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
Implementation of a user-friendly interface for individual diabetes prediction based on input features.
