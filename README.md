# DIABETES-PREDICTION-SVM
This project developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on health indicators. It followed a systematic approach encompassing data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Techniques included Support Vector Machines (SVM), grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
